<h1>Functional Dyspepsia</h1>

<p>
Functional dyspepsia is a disorder of the gut brain interaction (DGBI), meaning there is a miscommunication between the brain and stomach.
This condition makes the patient feel full even when only consuming small amounts of food.
They may also experience the feeling of being overly full after meals, and/or pain or burning on the upper left side near the ribcage.
Since there is a miscommunication happening between the brain and stomach the stomach may not expand enough, giving the patient the feeling of being full with small amounts of food.
</p>
<p>
When diagnosing functional dyspepsia, we first rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms the patient is feeling.
This includes acid reflux, ulcers/H pylori infection, and gastroparesis.
</p>
<p>
Treatment for functional dyspepsia includes medication and dietary modifications.
