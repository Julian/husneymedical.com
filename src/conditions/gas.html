<h1>Gas and Bloating</h1>

<p>
Having gas is a normal part of the way your digestive system works.
However, when it comes to gas not passing properly, it can cause discomfort and bloating.
It may also be an indication of an underlying condition.
If the patient is experiencing symptoms such as blood in stool, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or unexplained weight loss, the patient should consult their physician.
</p>
<p>
Treatment is tailored to underlying cause of the symptoms.
