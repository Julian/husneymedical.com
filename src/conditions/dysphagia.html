<h1>Dysphagia</h1>

<p>
Dysphagia is when a person has a difficult time swallowing.
If dysphagia is a recurring issue, this may indicate an underlying problem with the mouth, pharynx, or esophagus.
</p>

<p>
Symptoms may include: pain, coughing or gagging when attempting to swallow, heartburn, feeling hoarse, regurgitation, unintended weight loss, and excess saliva production.
</p>

<p>
There are two types of dysphagia based on their location.
</p>

  <h2 id="oropharyngeal">
    <a class="no-underline hover:text-green-500" aria-label="Anchor" href="#oropharyngeal">
      <span>Oropharyngeal dysphagia</span>
      <span class="pl-2 text-xl cursor-pointer">#</span>
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is when the patient is having difficulties beginning to swallow.
    This may cause the patient to cough, gag, or feel as though the food or liquid is going down the wrong pipe.
    This may indicate an issue with the brain’s communication to the mouth or throat.
  </p>

  <h2 id="esophageal">
    <a class="no-underline hover:text-green-500" aria-label="Anchor" href="#esophageal">
      <span>Esophageal dysphagia</span>
      <span class="pl-2 text-xl cursor-pointer">#</span>
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This may indicate a structural or neuromuscular issue involving the esophagus.
    The patient may feel as though food is getting stuck in their throat, or stuck in their chest.
    Underlying conditions may include: GERD, scarring or inflammation, or cancer of the stomach or esophagus.
  </p>

<p>
When diagnosing dysphagia, we begin by taking the patient’s family and personal medical history, and conduct a physical examination.
We then will recommend tests such as an endoscopy procedure or x-ray imaging.
This will give us the opportunity to see if there are any internal issues.
</p>

<p>
Treatment of dysphagia may include, making adjustments to the patient’s diet, medication, or conducting an endoscopy procedure to either dilate the esophagus if there is a narrow section or if necessary remove the object that is blocking the esophagus.
