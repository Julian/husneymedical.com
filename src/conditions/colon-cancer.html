<h1>Colon Cancer</h1>

<p>
Colorectal cancer is cancer that originates in the colon, the large intestine, or the rectum, the end of the colon.
There is no single cause of colon cancer. Commonly, colon cancers begin as benign polyps that can slowly develop into cancer.
</p>
<p>
In many cases of colon cancer, there are no symptoms.
However, in the case where one does experience symptoms, some examples are abdominal pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen, blood in the stool, diarrhea, constipation, or other change in bowel habits, or unexplained weight loss.

<p>
Diagnosing colon cancer is usually done by screening tests even before symptoms present themselves.
A physical examination is rarely able to indicate cancer unless there is a mass in the abdominal region.
A colonoscopy is the best way to confirm if there is cancer.
