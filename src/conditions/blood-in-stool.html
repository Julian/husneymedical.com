<h1>Blood in Stool</h1>

<p>
When there is blood in one’s stool, this may be a result of bleeding from anywhere in the GI tract.
Blood in the stool may appear in different colors depending on the source of the bleeding.
When the blood is black or “sticky”, this may indicate bleeding from the upper organs of the GI tract, for example, from the stomach or esophagus.
If the blood appears more maroon or burgundy, or most commonly, a bright red color after a bowel movement this most likely indicates bleeding from the colon, rectum or anus.
</p>

<p>
Diagnosing the source of the bleeding will begin with a review of the symptoms, evaluation of personal and family medical histories, and a physical exam.
A blood and stool test may be required, and commonly an endoscopy and colonoscopy will be required to be able to better evaluate the cause of the bleeding internally.
In some cases, further imaging, such as small bowel capsule endoscopy or CT scan, may be necessary.
