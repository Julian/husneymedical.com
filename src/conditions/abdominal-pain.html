<h1>Abdominal Pain</h1>

<p>
Abdominal pain is pain that is felt anywhere between your chest and groin areas of the body, commonly referred to as the stomach region.
Abdominal pain can occur from organs of the digestive tract, or from other organs located in the pelvic and abdominal region.
</p>
<p>
Common disorders that can cause abdominal pain include, but are not limited to, infection, gaseous distension, ulcer formation, obstruction or blockage, inflammation, or perforation.
</p>
<p>
To gather further information to address your abdominal pain, we start with performing a physical exam in order to better assess your pain.
Tests, such as a stool, blood or urine test; a CT or MRI scan; may be required.
Procedures, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy may be required to be able to get an internal look at any possible causes.
