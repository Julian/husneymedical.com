## Prescription Medications for Weight Loss

This plan involves combining the healthy eating, Calorie Controlled Plan with an FDA-approved prescription medication for weight loss.
These medications lessen your appetite or can make you feel full earlier.
Our Prescription Medication Plan includes Initial consultation with our our doctor to talk about your personal weight loss goals.
He will also decide if you’re a good candidate for weight loss medication.
Regular meetings with your doctor are used to evaluate your progress.
Clinical exams and bloodwork as needed depending on the medications you’re on.
