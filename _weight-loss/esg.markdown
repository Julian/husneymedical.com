title: Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty

## What is Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty?

<p>
Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), also known as the accordion procedure, involves using an endoscope with an attached suturing device to place sutures in the stomach.
ESG is a minimally invasive procedure that doesn’t require any incisions on the outside of your body and you won’t have any external scars.
The recovery time is also much faster than traditional surgery.
</p>

<p>
The results of the procedure are similar to that of gastric sleeve surgery (VSG) but without all the associated surgical risks.
The time ESG is much shorter than for gastric sleeve or other types of bariatric surgery so patients can return to their life sooner.

## How is ESG performed and how does it work for weight loss?

<p>
While you are sedated, your doctor puts an endoscope through your mouth and into your stomach.
The endoscope has a suturing device attached to it.
The suturing device is used to suture small accordion-like folds into the stomach to make it smaller and decrease its length.
When these folds are stitched into your stomach tissue, there’s less room in your stomach to hold food.
With a smaller stomach, you feel full faster and tend to eat less as a result.

## What is recovery like after ESG?

<p>
Patients typically go home the same day as the procedure.
You first follow a full liquid meal plan, which includes protein shakes and similar products.
You then transition to a soft food plan (including easy-to-eat foods, like oatmeal, bananas and soft-cooked rice).
Finally, you can return to regular eating.
People usually take 1 to 2 days off work.
You should avoid lifting heavy objects after the procedure.

## Are there any additional health benefits, besides weight loss?

<p>
You may experience better health, like improvements in weight-related health conditions.
These can include sleep apnea, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia.
Dyslipidemia is when you have abnormal amounts of lipids (fats) in your blood.
In some case, these conditions may even resolve completely.
