title: Intragastric Balloon Weight Loss Procedure
---

<p>
An endoscopic weight loss procedure is a non-surgical approach that uses an endoscope for your weight loss treatment, instead of external incisions (cuts).
An endoscope is a thin, flexible tube that helps a doctor view your digestive system.
Endoscopic procedures are considered very safe and less risky than surgery.

## What is an intragastric balloon?

<p>
The intragastric balloon is a silicone balloon that’s about the size of a grapefruit or a softball.
When placed in your stomach, the balloon limits the amount of food you can eat and makes you feel full faster.
Over time, this helps you to lose weight.

## How is the intragastric balloon procedure performed?

<p>
While you’re sedated, the balloon is placed into stomach using an endoscope.
Once the balloon is placed in the stomach, it’s filled with saline.
After treatment with the balloon, patients wake up and go home that same day.
After 6 months, the balloon is removed.
