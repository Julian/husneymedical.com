An ulcer is an open lesion found on the lining of the stomach or intestines.
              Symptoms may include abdominal pain, feeling like you have an empty stomach about an hour after eating, nausea, vomiting, bloody or dark stool, fatigue, weight loss, and heartburn.

    Located in the first part of the small intestine, known as the duodenum.

<p>
Causes may include an infection of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori), drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, the overusage of nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen, smoking, and stress.
</p>
<p>
When diagnosing ulcers we will begin by taking the family and personal medical histories and performing a physical examination. We may recommend the patient get an endoscopy procedure, where we will biopsy the lesion to do further testing for H pylori infections or cancer.
</p>
<p>
When treating ulcers, it depends on the location of the ulcer and the cause.
Treatment can take about 8 weeks with medications that will aid in the control of stomach acid.
If the cause of the ulcers are NSAIDs, the doctor will recommend that the patient lower the amount they are taking or to switch medications.
