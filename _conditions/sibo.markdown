title: Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)
---

<p>
It is normal for our bodies to have bacteria in areas such as the colon.
Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth, SIBO, is when an individual has an excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestines where bacteria usually does not grow.
Symptoms may include gas and bloating, diarrhea, indegestion, nausea and cramping, and abdominal pain.

<p>
SIBO can result from conditions such as celiac disease, or crohn's disease.

<p>
When diagnosing SIBO, we will begin by taking your family and personal medical histories and performing a physical examination. Then we may run further tests including a vitamin level test, special breath tests, an endoscopy where we can take a small biopsy or culture.

Treatment may include antibiotics, other medications to be able to improve intestinal movements, and giving malnourished patients nutrition. Avoiding lactose has proven to be helpful as well.
