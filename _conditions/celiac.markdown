title: Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity
---

<p>
Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that occurs when your immune system reacts negatively to the protein, gluten, leading to damages of the lining of the small intestine.
The damages lead to the small intestines not being able to absorb nutrients from food properly. Gluten is a substance that is found in many different grains and other food products.

<p>
There is currently no cure for Celiac disease, however, in most cases eliminating gluten from oneâ€™s diet will alleviate the symptoms and give time for your body's intestinal tract time to heal.
Dietary modifications include avoiding wheat, barley, oats, and other products that state they contain gluten.

    Those with gluten intolerance exhibit symptoms of Celiac disease when ingesting gluten, however, do not test positive for the antibodies associated with the disease and do not present with damage to the small intestines.
