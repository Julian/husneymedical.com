title: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
---

Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a condition where there is a build-up of white blood cells traveling along your esophagus.
This condition causes the patientâ€™s esophagus to become inflamed, making it difficult for the patient to swallow food.
This can be caused by a reaction to certain foods, allergens, or reflux.

To diagnose EoE, we will begin by performing an endoscopy procedure to be able to take a biopsy from the esophagus for testing.

Treatment for EoE includes diet change, and/or medication.
