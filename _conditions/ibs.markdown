title: Irritable Bowel Syndrome
---

<p>
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is a condition that affects the large intestine.
Symptoms for IBS may not always be constant, however, they do require long-term management.
IBS is not life threatening, but can range from being a minor inconvenience in one’s life to significantly reducing one’s quality of life.
Symptoms may include adbominal pain, change in your bowel movements, anxiety, depression, nausea, and persistent constipation and diarrhea.

<p>
When diagnosing IBS, there is no specific way to test for it.
We will begin by ruling out other disorders that present similarly to IBS, such as Celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or an infection.
We may also recommend doing a blood and stool test, imaging scans, or an endoscopy.
