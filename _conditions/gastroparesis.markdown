title: Gastroparesis
---

Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach is unable to empty its contents entirely.
This condition does not involve an obstruction, it may involve a disconnect with the stomach and nervous system.
Risk factors may include diabetes, gastrectomy, ststemic sclerosis, or using medications that may block specific nerve signals in the body.

Symptoms of gastroparesis may include GERD or heartburn, nausea, vomiting, malnutrition and dehydration, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia (for those with diabetes), feeling overly full after meals, blockages formed from the undigested food, or the abdominal region is swollen.

When diagnosing gastroparesis, an endoscopy procedure may be required. Other tests such as a gastic emptying study, or an upper GI series may be necessary as well.

Treatment for gastroparesis include dietary modification, medication, or treatments such as botox being injected into the pylorus, or a surgical procedure called a gastroenterostomy to create a passageway between the stomach and small intestines.
