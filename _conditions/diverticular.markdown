    Diverticulosis is a condition where these pouches have formed in the GI tract, but the patient usually will appear asymptomatic.
    In some cases when the patient is symptomatic, they may experience symptoms such as cramping, bloating, or constipation.

    Diverticulitis is a condition where these pouches (diverticula), become infected or inflamed.
    Symptoms of diverticulitis are more severe than those of diverticulosis.
    The patient may feel abdominal tenderness in the lower region of the stomach, bloating, fever, nausea and vomiting, and a loss of appetite.

  <p>
  Risk factors may include diet, age, obesity, and lifestyle choices such as smoking.
  </p>

  <p>
  Diagnosing diverticulitis include, a blood test, an ultrasound, or a CT or X-ray scan.
  </p>

  <p>
  Treatment of diverticulitis includes bed rest, medication, and a liquid diet for two days then slowly integrating food into the diet.
